This project is about Bit Manipulation refers to the process of directly manipulating bits (binary digits) of a number using bitwise operators. It is a low-level technique used to perform operations on data at the level of individual bits, and it is highly efficient because it directly interacts with the hardware representation of the data.

Bitwise operators are the key tools used in bit manipulation. They operate on the binary representation of integers, performing operations like AND, OR, XOR, shifts, etc. Here are some commonly used bitwise operators and their functionalities:
