This project is part of the low-level programming curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on file input/output system calls in C on Linux using POSIX APIs.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Look for the right source of information online
- Understand how to create, open, close, read and write files in C
- Use system calls: `open`, `read`, `write`, `close`
- Understand file descriptors
- Handle file permissions
- Use symbolic constants (like `O_RDONLY`, `STDOUT_FILENO`) instead of hard-coded values

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- GCC with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- No global variables
- No use of `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc.
- Only allowed C standard functions: `malloc`, `free`, `exit`
- Allowed system calls: `read`, `write`, `open`, `close`
- Follow Betty style (`betty-style.pl`, `betty-doc.pl`)
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Use symbolic constants from `unistd.h` and `fcntl.h`

## Files

- All prototypes are in `main.h`
- Header files are include guarded
- Test files (`main.c`) are not pushed to the repository
